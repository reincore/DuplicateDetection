# DuplicateDetection
Handling a large dataset with .json files to read the values and detect duplicates.

Parser.py is outdated, it's merely a sketch. Duplicate.py does the work. Refer to 
the comments to get a more clear view of what is done. Key.csv is an obtained .CSV 
output as an example.

Duplicate.py should be in the same directory with the folder that contains the
duplicate submissions. The output file in .csv format will also be in this 
directory.
